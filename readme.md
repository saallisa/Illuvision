# Illuvision Engine

[![DeepScan grade](https://deepscan.io/api/teams/27485/projects/30515/branches/980824/badge/grade.svg)](https://deepscan.io/dashboard#view=project&tid=27485&pid=30515&bid=980824)

This is an unfinished and experimental 3D rendering engine for WebGPU only.
It is free of dependencies and is coded in plain JavaScript.
Once I reach a stage of development that appears to be useful and error-free,
I will make the code completely open source.
In the meantime, I advise against using it for anything other than experimentation.

## How to use
